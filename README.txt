Things I learned about Git today:
	-'git init' - initialized the repository
	-'mkdir [name]' - make a directory
	-'touch [name]' - make a file
	-'vim [name]' - open a file in vim text editor
	-'git status' - check the status of a git repo
	-'git add [directory]' - add file/directory to 'stage'
	-'git commit' - "takes a picture" of our stage and commits it to history
	  (can add a message)
	-'git reset' - unstages changes
	-'git reset --hard' - unstages changes and removes changes from file

	  in vim:
	  	-'i' opens insert mode
		-'esc' exits to 'hotkey mode'
		-':w' saves
		-':q' quits
		-':wq' save and quit
		-':q!' quits without saving

I may need to re-type all of this when I fix the directory to where I want this to be XD
